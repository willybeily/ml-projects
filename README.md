# ml-projects
First project is an app here spam/ham prediction is done. In projectednotebad.ipynb file naive bayes algorithm is used to train data
and then made pickle files of vect and nb where in nb has naive bayes model and vect contain vector form of speach.txt data from where count vectorizer is made.
In app.py file extraction of pickle files named vect, nb is done and then I used web frame work to show user text area where he has to enter any sentence and after he enters it, it will show spam and ham on the page
